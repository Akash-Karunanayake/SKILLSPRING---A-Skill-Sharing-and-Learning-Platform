# ******************
# ⚠️ THIS IS A FAKE PROJECT! AN ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT!! A CHEATING!!!

## 📌 READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

This repository was originally uploaded with code that **was not written by me or my team**.  
It was **outsourced** — a shortcut taken out of fear, pressure, and irresponsibility.

I pretended it was ours.  
But it wasn’t. It was a fraud.

I was the leader.  
I should have done better.  
I failed.

## 🧠 WHY THIS REPO STILL EXISTS

I’ve left this repo up not to hide it, but to **own it**.  
This repo is now a symbol of **how far I fell** and where I **begin again**.

> "The truth burns, but the fire will forge me."

## 🛠️ WHAT COMES NEXT

This README will stay here as-is, forever.  
I will **restart this project**, rebuild every line of code with honesty and discipline.

## 💬 Final Words

To my teammates:  
I’m sorry I let you down. I don’t expect forgiveness. Just watch what I do from here on.

To anyone else reading this:  
Take this as proof — **owning your failure is step one**.  
The rest? Earn it.
